# better-mpv-config
An improved MPV Player configuration file with useful defaults and profiles and no additional cruft.

## Windows Users
Save to the file %APPDATA%/mpv/mpv.conf

## Linux Users
You can put all of the options in configuration files which will be read every time mpv is run.

The system-wide configuration file 'mpv.conf' is in your configuration directory (e.g. /etc/mpv or /usr/local/etc/mpv).

The user-specific one is ~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf.
